# Front-end Project

## Student's notes

I will try to complete this project later on during the Integrify program. For now I have done everything I could and I don't have enough time to complete it by now!

## Requirements

1. TypeScript and Unit testing are required in your project
2. Use the API endpoint [https://fakeapi.platzi.com/](https://fakeapi.platzi.com/). Read the documentation and learn how to use the different endpoints.
3. Create at least 4 pages (can be more if you want): Home page, product page,
   profile page (only available if user logins), and cart page (cart could be a page or a modal)
4. Use context API to create a button to switch themes of the web app
5. Create Redux store for following features:

- product reducer: get all products, find a single products, sort products by
  categories, sort products by price, update and delete a product (enable update & delete features only for admin of the webapp. For example, you can check if user is your account before let them delete product)
- user reducer: get all users, find a single user, create new user (delete user is not allowed in this api)
- cart reducer: add product to cart, remove products, update products's quantity in cart

6. Your UI should have functions according to the Redux store

## Instruction to start the project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Install all the dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
